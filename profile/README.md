# Building protocols for the future of the Internet

Fission is building the _identity_, _data_ & _compute_ primitives that enable true local-first edge applications.

## Working Groups

We don't get to the future alone. Fission collaborates with other developers and organizations through a variety of working groups.

- [UCAN (User Controlled Authorization Networks) Working Group](https://github.com/ucan-wg) - a trustless, secure, local-first, user-originated authorization and revocation scheme.
- [WNFS (Webnative Filesystem) Working Group](https://github.com/wnfs-wg/) - a versioned, logged, programmable, flexibly secure distributed file system.
- [IPVM (Interplanetary Virtual Machine) Working Group](https://github.com/ipvm-wg) - an open, decentralized, and local-first execution layer for IPFS.

## ODD SDK
Fission's true local-first, edge computing stack. The ODD SDK empowers you to build fully distributed web applications with auth and storage without needing a complex backend.

- [SDK](https://github.com/oddsdk/ts-odd) - the base SDK for building ODD apps
- [Docs](https://docs.odd.dev/) - documentation on using the ODD SDK
- [App Template](https://github.com/oddsdk/odd-app-template) - clone-and-go template for quickly building a web app using the ODD SDK.
- [Examples](https://github.com/oddsdk/odd-app-template) - example apps built with the ODD SDK.
- [Whitepaper](https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper) - original whitepaper that outlines the ODD SDK vision.
